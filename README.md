## Hi there 👋

<h3>
  About me
</h3>

I am Daniel, an international student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences with the ambition to become a Full-Stack Engineer and contribute to Computer Science research!

I mainly love building web-applications, but also enjoy building projects with arduino's to develop products that improve my life.

My dream is to use my skills in software engineering to build tools for 🏥🧑‍⚕️medical research/healthcare, 🎨✏️develop animation software, or compete at the highest stage of motorsports; 🏎️ Formula 1

What I am currently working on:

- Learning React + NextJS to start freelancing

- 🦊🌳 A project for Natuurmonumenten: An animal clicker game that helps build the user's knowledge about the animal life in the Netherlands in a playful manner

- 🧑‍🎓🏫 A bachelor's degree at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences with the ambition to pursue a Master's in Software Engineering at University of Amsterdam
